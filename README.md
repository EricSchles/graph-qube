# MIT Lincoln Laboratory Graph QuBE: Probabilistic Query-by-Example of Large Graphs
=====

This project provides a tool to enable efficient pattern-of-behavior search in data containing entities transacting over time. 

From the user's point-of-view, this tools helps to answer the basic question: "If I have an interesting pattern of behavior between some entities-of-interest, can I look through all my data to find other such examples of this type of behavior?"

Links to the appropriate documentation are given below:

## System Description 

The following links give an overview of the underlying technology used by the Graph QuBE system. These documents provide some context on how this technology works as well as some context as to how it compares to other similar technologies.

## Building and Running on Example Data

The following links outline how to build, launch and use Graph QuBE from the distributed source. An example program is provided that llustrates how the data ingest process can be done from a sample data set.
